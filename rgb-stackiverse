RGB Stackiverse
===============

A universal structure for plotting narrative into [virtual] physical space. (Early Release Announcement)

# Premise
Steamboat Willie, in the Public Domain as of January 1, 2024. Where does he come from? Where does he go?
Now available for remix in stories everywhere. 
Consider that Steamboat Willie, starring a famous rat-presenting deck swab, introduced in media res circa 1928, is not a talkie. There is no dialogue, but the combination of moving picture and sound is in full display as an experimental medium. Most of the sound effects could be reproduced reliably in a theater, with different performers in different cities. Was the script an artifact of Vaudeville methods, adapted to silent film, to describe sequences of hijinks that could be performed / improvised night after night? As unpublished corporate artifacts, is it known whether production notes exist, unseen by public eye? Where are these questions going? Does it matter? No! This is a narrative framework -- not a story.

# Example Use
If you want to understand and describe Accessibility in more accessible terms, what modalities (beyond text) can you consider for a mind that is not your own? If you are sighted, you can imagine explaining what you see to someone who is visually impaired. If you are not sighted, you can also imagine this. Ted Chiang posits Heptapod A and Heptapod B as two languages, one written and one spoken. They are rather different than each other, but exhibit properties that are plausibly consistent with deity-like entities who exist outside of time as conceived by humans. Personally, this writer does not have omniscient, or even partially scient Future Vision. Do you?

# Selection of "facts" about the RGB Stackiverse

* The RGB Stackiverse is a theoretical framework for drawing a map of fictional (but navigable) space.
* It is designed to be describable in words at several resolutions, allowing the reader to easily develop a mental picture.
* First, imagine an area of great importance at the center, e.g. the Palace in Citadel City at the center of the Stack Kingdom.
* Next, imagine radius circle around that centerpoint as a series of important stopping points in a compass rose.
* Consider these stopping points to be north, south, east, and west.
* Next, consider that you want to only have three major arcs in your journey from start to finish.
* Consider that all stories must end where they began.
* That is, consider that all stories must have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
* Consider that *not* all stories start at the north-most gate of the city, but if they do, they should also end there.
* There are several further lemmas (lemmae?) about how the three points on the circle can never correspond with more than one of the cardinal directions.
** This is assuming that all arcs must be equal, whether the 3-act or 4-act formula.
*** This is not a formal mathematical proof, merely an (intended) accessible introduction to how they work.
* Since all stories end where they begin, we as narrative architects are naming the arcs, not the points.
** There is probably something interesting about non-Euclidean spaces that both do and don't end where they begin.
* A narrative planner might typically outline a story with a Beginning, Middle, and End.
* Thus the "three compass points" of a story do not name the arcs -- they name the separating points of every cycle segment.
* By convention we name the start/end point at the northmost point of the circle as "Red"
* By convention we name the southeast-ish point separating the beginning and middle third-arcs to be "Green"
* Thus, the southwest-ish point separating the middle and end third-arcs, we name "Blue"
* These conventions might be communicated differently in a society that has more advanced pigment-mixing as compared to their optics-tuning technology.
** The author(s) refer to subtractive color versus additive color here. The basis of this OOMM is additive aka light-mixing color.
*** Can we imagine a sentient being that evoles on the surface of a sun, whose organs are therefore more finely tuned to the *absence* of light?
* These don't really seem like facts anymore, do they?
* Some stories begin in the middle.
* Tell your story however you want.
